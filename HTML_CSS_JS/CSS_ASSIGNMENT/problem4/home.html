        <p>Michelle Hake's sister had been snowed in for days, alone in her Big Bear home. Her family said it wasn't
            clear just how urgent her medical needs had become during last month's record-setting snowstorms and the
            treacherous days that followed.

            She "needed medical attention in the midst of the storm, and we could not get that to her," Hake said. Her
            family called for an emergency wellness check Monday.

            "We were too late," she said.

            Deputies with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department found Hake's sister dead just after 9 a.m.,
            agency spokesperson Mara Rodriguez said. A cause of death has not been determined, but Rodriguez said there
            were no signs of trauma or suspicious circumstances.

            Hake, who requested that her adult sister not be identified, declined to expound on her sister's medical
            history or what might have led to her death. But she said she had no doubt that her sister would have gotten
            the care she needed had the storms not trapped her inside.

            “We were trying to get someone to go check on her,” Hake said. “There was literally no access to get to her;
            she lives alone. And for so many that are [stuck] in their homes, that is their story."
